## Week 1
### (10/07/2024 - 10/14/2024)
 
* We had our initial stakeholder meeting in this week.
* We interacted with Prof. Rob Cavanaugh to get and idea about the problem statement and expectations out of this project.
* We further got information about the pre-requirements in the form of certifications that need to be completed in the next week.
 
## Week 2
### (10/15/2024 -  10/20/2024)
* We finished CITI certifications as mentioned in stakeholder meet in Week 1 to get access to the dataset.
* We completed the below certifications offered by CITI :
    * Conflict of Interest mini-course (Curriculum Group) Conflict of Interest (Course Learner Group)
 
    * Social & Behavioral Research - Basic/Refresher (Curriculum Group) Human Subjects Research (Course Learner Group)
 
    * Social and Behavioral Responsible Conduct of Research (Curriculum Group) Social and Behavioral Responsible Conduct of Research (Course Learner Group)
 
## Week 3
### (10/21/2024 - 10/27/2024)
* We had a meeting with Prof. Rob Cavanaugh to understand how to setup workspaces and the issues that we faced while installed the requirements.
* We got clarification about the same and we incorporated the feedback.
* We installed python and installed all the required libraries and queried parts of data for initial EDA.
 
 
## Week 4
### (10/28/2024 - 11/03/2024 )
* We made initial EDA with the data that we were able to access.
* We interacted with capstone students and got their cohort definition and based on these talks , we made changes to our cohorts.
* Based on our research, we showed Prof. Rob about the same and incorporated the suggestions that were told.
 
## Week 5
### (11/04/2024 - 11/17/2024)
* In this week , we had our first checkin and showed all the changes that we made since our last meeting.
* Professor suggested us to incorporate "Brainstem Ischema" and "Brainstem hammoaerage" concept codes to our cohorts too.
* We got a clarity on the pathways to proceed and pathways to not peroceed.
* We got a sugggestion to avoid the path that deals with answering of causal question as we won't be able to do it , give the timeline and the scope of the project.
 
## Week 6 & further
### (11/18/2024 - )
* We are about to do the following things , given the timeline and scope of the project :
    * Treatment Duration:
        * We will analyze how the duration of different treatments correlates with the types of care received and patient characteristics. This will help identify how long patients typically stay within certain treatment pathways and whether certain durations correlate with more effective outcomes.
    * Diagnostic Procedures:
        * A detailed examination of the diagnostic procedures undertaken at various stages of care to understand whether specific diagnostics correlate with treatment effectiveness. This will help us evaluate the care quality provided at different stages of treatment, even without long-term outcome data.


## Roles and responsibilities

* Ramakrishna Chavali : Worked on Concept , procedure and visit_detail table to find insights/patterns on stroke.
* Akash Dhande : Worked on treatment pathways by joining various tables to find key insights on the treatments.
* Omkar Sonar : Worked on procedure and visit table to find insights on the procedures taken by people who have the strokes that are listed.
