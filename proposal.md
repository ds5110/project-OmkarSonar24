# Proposal: Revisions to the Original Story

## Introduction

After several discussions with Rob Cavanaugh (stakeholder) and a closer look at the available data, we have refined the direction of this project. The original story outlined an ambitious plan to investigate the full spectrum of care transitions for stroke survivors, including detailed patterns of care and their outcomes. However, the data available for analysis does not fully support this level of investigation, particularly regarding patient outcomes such as mortality, recurrence of strokes, or improvement post-treatment.

## Changes from Original Story

### 1. Data Limitations
Initial approach was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of individual treatment pathways by measuring metrics such as mortality rates, stroke recurrence and quality of life at the end of a treatment pathway. However due to the non-standard nature of the data, there exist a lot of irregularities which make it very difficult to calculate these metrics.

### 2. Tight Timelines
Given the limited class timeline, which is shorter than a typical capstone project, it leaves us with limited time to spend on data exploration and hence forces us to decide our objective with agility requiring a more focused approach. Also, the number of large inter-related tables and the time required to query them poses a challenge. <br>

### 3. Refined Focus
Our current objective after discussing with Rob, is to compare the treatment pathways taken by patients who have had different types of strokes categorised into Ischemic Stroke, Haemorrhagic Stroke and Cryptogenic Stroke. The analysis will/may include comparisons on the basis of -
- Treatment location
- Treatment providers visited
- Types of treatment(only the ones relevant to stroke)
- Duration of treatments

Additionally we look forward to draw some conclusions on the basis of the above analysis and explore further in a more targeted manner.

## Risks and Limitations
Data Limitation: The primary risk is the lack of detailed outcome data, such as mortality rates or improvements in mobility and cognition. This limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of treatment pathways on long-term outcomes.

Generalizability: The findings may be limited in scope due to the data being based on claims data, which may not fully capture the clinical nuances of patient care.


## Conclusion

With our revised approach which offers a data-driven solution to understanding stroke survivor care pathways, we plan to learn the healthcare domain and analyse various apsects within this. By shifting the focus from broad care transitions to specific treatment pathways, we can provide valuable insights into how these pathways relate to key metrics like treatment duration and diagnostic procedures. This refined focus will allow us to contribute actionable insights for improving care protocols and optimizing stroke rehabilitation. This is our first time analysing such a huge medical dataset and we plan to take advantage of this oppurtunity to apply our data exploratory concepts which we learned in the class.
