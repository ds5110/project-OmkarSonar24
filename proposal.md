# Proposal: Revisions to the Original Story

## Introduction

After several discussions with Rob Cavanaugh (stakeholder) and a closer look at the available data, we have refined the direction of this project. The original story outlined an ambitious plan to investigate the full spectrum of care transitions for stroke survivors, including detailed patterns of care and their outcomes. However, the data available for analysis does not fully support this level of investigation, particularly regarding patient outcomes such as mortality, recurrence of strokes, or improvement post-treatment.

## Changes from Original Story

### 1. Data Limitations
Initial approach was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of indivual treatment pathways by measuring metrics such as mortality rates, stroke recurrence and quality of life at the end of a treatment pathway. However due to the non-standard nature of the data, there exist a lot of irregularities which make it very difficult to calculate these metrics.

### 2. Tight Timelines
Given the limited class timeline, which is shorter than a typical capstone project, it leaves us with limited time to spend on data exploration and hence forces us to decide our objective with agility requiring a more focused approach. Also, the number of large inter-related tables and the time required to query them poses a challenge. <br>

### 3. Refined Focus
Our current objective after discussing with Rob, is to compare the treatment pathways taken by patients who have had different types of strokes categorised into Ischemic Stroke, Haemorrhagic Stroke and Cryptogenic Stroke. The analysis will/may include comparisons on the basis of -
- Treatment location
- Treatment providers visited
- Types of treatment(only the ones relevant to stroke)
- Duration of treatments

Additionally we look forward to draw some conclusions on the basis of the above analysis and explore further in a more targeted manner.

## Approach

### Objectives
To adapt to the data limitations and the project's shorter timeline, we have revised the objectives as follows:

1. **Compare Treatment Pathway Effectiveness**:  
   We will examine how different treatment pathways correlate with treatment duration and specific diagnostic procedures. The goal is to identify whether certain pathways are more effective in terms of patient care, based on available metrics.

2. **Treatment Pathway Comparison Across Stroke Types**:  
   Focusing on procedures undergone by patients, we will explore how treatment pathways differ for various types of strokes (ischemic, hemorrhagic, cryptogenic). This could provide insights into how patients with different stroke types are treated across various levels of care.

3. **Diagnostic and Treatment Focus**:  
   The focus will shift towards evaluating the types of diagnostic tests and treatments patients undergo at various stages of care. This will allow us to examine the quality and consistency of care at different stages, even without detailed outcome data.

- **Treatment Duration**:  
   We will analyze how the duration of different treatments correlates with the types of care received and patient characteristics. This will help identify how long patients typically stay within certain treatment pathways and whether certain durations correlate with more effective outcomes.

- **Diagnostic Procedures**:  
   A detailed examination of the diagnostic procedures undertaken at various stages of care to understand whether specific diagnostics correlate with treatment effectiveness. This will help us evaluate the care quality provided at different stages of treatment, even without long-term outcome data.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our revised approach offers a feasible and data-driven solution to understanding stroke survivor care pathways. By shifting the focus from broad care transitions to specific treatment pathways, we can provide valuable insights into how these pathways relate to key metrics like treatment duration and diagnostic procedures. This refined focus will allow us to contribute actionable insights for improving care protocols and optimizing stroke rehabilitation, despite the data limitations.
